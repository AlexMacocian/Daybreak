To display other images than the ones retrieved from "http://bloogum.net/guildwars", place images in the Screenshots folder, next to the Daybreak.exe executable. If the folder doesn't exist yet, either create it or run the launcher once so that it gets created automatically.

To adjust accounts, go into account settings. Clicking on the star next to an account sets it as the current account.
