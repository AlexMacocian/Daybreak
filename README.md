To display other images than the ones retrieved from "http://bloogum.net/guildwars", place images in the Screenshots folder, next to the Daybreak.exe executable. If the folder doesn't exist yet, either create it or run the launcher once so that it gets created automatically.

To adjust accounts, go into account settings. Clicking on the star next to an account sets it as the current account.

To dynamically load a build, while browsing in the browsers from the main page, select and rightclick any text on the page that might be a template. If it is a template, the client will open a context menu with a button called "Load build template". Click on that button to load the build and switch to build template view.
